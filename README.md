# Objectives

Extension to launch electron app from github
Gitpod launch buttons in README doc itself (no need to install extension)
Control over what config, I want to launch
Way to see logs from CloudWatch functions for my env directly
Buttons to run different scripts on external IDE instead
Auto setup Jetbrains IDE config (or have some config persistence)
- Electron app 


# Issues:
Not fullscreen
Hotkeys to override
